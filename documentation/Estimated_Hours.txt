Estimated Hours for Front-End UI to access widgets: 10h
Estimated Hours per Widget: 5-7h
Estimated Time for additional documentation/artifacts/UML Diagrams: 5-7h

Assuming 5 Widgets, Estimate Time is ~50 person hours
Using the Agile Story Method, Combining the time it takes to both make games (from previous game development)
&& the time it took to implement a UI we were able to come up with the above Estimate
Implementing two more higher quality games could take an additional 10-15 hrs
